Just a couple of utilities that make my life easier when developing web applications,nothing special.
	
JsConcat : a simple node script to concantenate all files giving to it;
less-watcher: a simple timer based less file watcher,updates your css files accordingly;
nodelib: a simple node list implementation for use in less-watcher;
require-js: a very old ,verbose concantenator,will not be update anymore;


Most of the scripts require  you to just include a build file in your working projects root directory
which provides all necessary details on what to do:

	for Less-Watcher:	create a build-less file in root directory of project,plug in a object literal like this:
	
		var watcher = require('less-watcher').LessWatcher;

		var settings = {
			"less" : "./assets/less",
			
			"css" : "./assets/css",
	
			"timeout" : 3000
		};

		watcher.init(settings);
		
	and then run node build-less to get running.
	
	
	for jsConcat:
	
		var config = {
			build_dir :" ./builds",
	
			use:{
	
				monster_engine: {
					name: 'monster_engine.js',
	    				src_dir : './assets/js',
	    				src:['editor.js','log/logger.js']
				},
			
			curler:{
				name: 'curler.js',
				src_dir : './assets/js/curler',
				src: ['curler.js']
				}
		
			}
		}
		
		
As of right now JsConcat is still unfinished!
